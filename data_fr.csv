1,"people who experience housing insecurity","When I think of people who experience housing insecurity, I think of people who are insecure with the house they own. They either want a bigger better house, or they are about to lose their house.","This person isn't happy with their life, they want better. They are sad and ashamed of what 'little' they have.","I just know what it means, I have never heard the term housing insecurity before. It makes them sound ashamed.","It sounds less harsh than insecurity","I don't perceive it in any way. That's what its always been called.","Not the best. It makes them sound sad and ashamed. Insecurity is not the term I would use.",NA,NA
2,"the homeless","Bad luck, drug use, unemployment","The person is homeless, but is kind and a person with feelings. Treat them with respect.","I prefer this term because it sounds less derogatory.","It sounds less offensive because when people hear the word ""homeless"", most of the time, they automatically think the homeless person is a drug user.","Neutral - it could be because the person did not think of an alternative word fast enough.","I prefer this term, as I believe people who use this term are trying to help the homeless person not look as embarrassed.",NA,NA
3,"people who experience housing insecurity","These people are homeless, may have lost their jobs or may have mental health and substance issues.","Someone who does not have enough money to afford a stable place to live long term.","I personally don't really care to dress up this language the way a lot of people do these days. Homeless is homeless. I think it's good to raise awareness that not all homeless people are scary and dangerous, though. But I don't think the phrase ""homeless"" should be considered offensive.","This term is more straight to the point and does not beat around the bush. To me, the other phrase feels insincere and performative without really making a tangible difference.","I would perceive them the same way I would perceive most normal people. Probably aren't super into the ""woke"" era of having to use fluffy terms to describe everything.","This person is probably chronically online, probably younger.",NA,NA
4,"people who experience housing insecurity","When I hear the term ""people who experience housing insecurity"", I think of homeless people.","Based on personal experience in my area, this person has a long history of drug use/abuse, is unemployed and can be violent/aggressive.","It is shorter, easier to say.","It is the most politically correct description.","I do not have any particular perceptions of someone who uses the term ""homeless"".
","I see them as someone who cares a lot about how they speak and how others feel about their words.",NA,NA
5,"the homeless","Unfortunate circumstances and a cruel world. I believe that homeless people were more likely to have certain socioeconomic traits that contribute to their current situation. It serves as a negative feedback loop where these traits (smoking, alcoholism, drug use, gambling) feed into each other and make the situation worse. Ultimately, the worst part of being homeless is becoming invisible to society.","This person has lost a bit of themselves: their personality, their whimsy, their empathy all in the name of survival. Everything that would be considered socially conventional is thrown out the window as they battle physical and psychological challenges. They are beaten and bruised mentally and physically, and have no choice but to sustain it and become numb to it. At times, this may result in feeding into destructive habits.","While generally I prefer terms that seem less charged, referring to it as ""housing insecurity"" doesn't do it justice to refer to the severity of the issue. ""The homeless"" hits a bit harder.","Simply put, terse labels are often generalized too often and abused to insult a group. I believe this term is comparable to ""the immigrants"" and ""the felons"" where it has a negative connotation in a lot of discussions.","I generally lean towards them as having a weak, baseless understanding of the issue.","I assume they are educated on the subject.",NA,NA
6,"the homeless","The people who under certain circumstances do not have a place to stay..","A person who is out on their luck with finding a place to stay or a job to keep.","It is straightforward and towards the fact that they do not have a place to stay.","It seems as though with detail it gives more understanding to the plight of the person.","I would believe that the person would be a bit more insensitive or straight-forward in addressing the person or group as homeless.","I think they are trying to explain the matter with more tact.",NA,NA
7,"the homeless","Cold, wandering people who live by the river but not off the land. Mental health issues obstruct their path to community. So they create a feral community of their own.","Dirty clothes and hair, seek or avoid eye contact, everything they own at their feet.","The other term is too long to say. For communication everyone knows what homeless means.","Because homeless the term is already saturated with feelings and emotions. The word has layers of meaning and PWEHI is new and has no connected connotations.","It depends on what they are saying about the homeless. If it is not offensive, I assume they are communicating in easy-to-understand language.","I presume they are a social worker or someone who works with PWEHI.",NA,NA
8,"the homeless","The associations that come to mind are soup kitchens and shelters","I feel this person would probably be seen in old clothes, slightly dirty, and generally unkept","I prefer the term the homeless because its simply what i grew up with plus its a very general way of speaking about them so it sounds less bad in my opinion.","I think the homeless is less offensive because its a general way of referring to that community of people.","I view someone depending on what they say after using the words the homeless. I think the name has no issues however what you say after can.","If someone used the term ""people who are experiencing housing insecurity"" around me i would be very confused and unsure what they were talking about.",NA,NA
9,"people who experience housing insecurity","Due to personal history, the first kind of person who comes to mind when hearing this is someone who has made poor decisions, trading housing security for immediate satisfaction in the form of vices.","Desperate, trying to find some way of securing their immediate situation in the short term. They may also be trying to find ways to distract themselves from the situation.","People who are experiencing housing insecurities is not as clear of a label. I could see that title applying to many people who are not currently homeless, whereas homeless is very clear on which subset of individuals it is referring to and what struggles they specifically are facing.","It's less embarrassing for the individual to phrase it as going through some insecurities as opposed to calling them homeless.","I've never thought of homeless as an offensive term before. As such I probably would not have had a second thought about someone using the term and it would not have affected my perception of them.","I would probably think they're attempting to be kind by using a less embarrassing term and I would respect that. However, as previously said I do think that term is less clear on exactly who it is referring to.",NA,NA
10,"people who experience housing insecurity","I think that lower income or renters are the ones who experiene this.","Middle income worker with both parents doing work just to get by.","That explaines it. I thought housing insecurities makes it sound like those that do not have a secure home, IE: renters, or a job you could lose anytime, not people who are homeless.","Because explaining what someone is can not be offensive.Its a fact, they do not have a current home.","That they understand that this homeless person has no home to go to.","Someone full of fear that just does as told.",NA,NA
11,"the homeless","Homeless are those who have unfortunate financial circumstances and/or mental health issues.  Usually related to drug abuse or family violence.","He would be friendly but shy to discuss circumstances.  Would likely ask for money but would not take true assistance - shelter, work, etc.","Because the other phrase is just dancing around the description.  To me housing insecurity is being one check a way from being homeless.

Adult female, disabled, cancer survivor, lost home due to SSDI denial and extraordinary fatigue.","""people experiencing housing insecurity"" could include people facing eviction, for instance, which is entirely different than living in a car in a Planet Fitness parking lot, or in a tent under a bridge.

Worked all their lives trying to support their family but inflation is outstripping wages to such a massive degree people can't keep up","I think it fits better with the increasing number of working poor that are temporarily without shelter.","There is less stigma attached to it. When people hear homeless they think of people who refuse to work, drug addicts and people with mental health issues","That is the known term so I don't hold it against people, but I see the stigma attached to it","I think they are trying to be sensitive and humanize people who experience homelessness",NA,NA

They need help.","They are unwell, but need help. They are dressed in layers.","Because it already says what it needs to say. Using ""unhoused"" or the ""people who whatever it was"" is just overly wordy. Why does homeless need to be changed?","It's fine. I don't see why we have to change it.","I think they're saying what needs to be say.","They want to be as progressive as possible and it's annoying.",NA,NA

Maria carries a backpack with her essentials, uses local shelters for safety, and spends her days at a library where she applies for jobs and works on improving her skills.","Because it is what I'm so familiar with","People doesn't see it be worse like that","homeless may be perceived as viewing homelessness as a defining characteristic rather than recognizing the individuality and humanity of the people experiencing it, though their intent might simply be to reference a social issue without mali","Someone who uses the term ""people who experience housing insecurity"" is likely perceived as empathetic and mindful, focusing on the temporary nature of the situation and emphasizing the individuals' humanity rather than defining them by their circumstances.",NA,NA

They don't havea  roof over their head at night. New clothes are scarce.","I think it gives it more of a respectful tone. That it doesn't define who they are but something they are currently experiencing. It has a more hopeful feel to it.","The homeless reduces these people down to their security.

There is really no typical type of person who experiences housing insecurity. But I could see them as being a young adult, hard working, doing the best they can.","I prefer it because there are a lot of negative stereotypes and ideas associated with “the homeless,” and “people who experience housing insecurity” correctly makes it sound more like it is a situation that a person experiences, not defining the person themself.","It is less offensive because instead of defining a person as “homeless”, which is a label with a lot of stereotypes and assumptions associated with it, it describes a situation that an individual is going through, and one that just about any individual could find themselves going through someday.","It is such a commonly used phrase that I wouldn’t necessarily think anything one way or another about someone who says it, but I would pay attention to whether they seem to be saying it with a sense of disgust or as if they’re looking down on unhoused people.","I would assume someone who uses this phrase is rather liberal in their philosophy and has compassion for people who experience housing insecurity, and thus is cautious and thoughtful about the way they describe certain groups of people.",NA,NA

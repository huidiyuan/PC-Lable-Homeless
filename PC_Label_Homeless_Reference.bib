Method: In Spring 2001, a representative survey was carried out in Germany involving adults of German nationality (n = 5025). Results: Labelling as mental illness has an impact on public attitudes towards people with schizophrenia, with negative effects clearly outweighing positive effects. Endorsing the stereotype of dangerousness has a strong negative effect on the way people react emotionally to someone with schizophrenia and increases the preference for social distance. By contrast, perceiving someone with schizophrenia as being in need for help evokes mixed feelings and affects people's desire for social distance both positively and negatively. Labelling has practically no effect on public attitudes towards people with major depression. Conclusion: Our findings illustrate the need for differentiation, differentiation between the different components of stigma as well as differentiation between the various mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Aim:               The contribution of this paper to this ongoing debate, is to interrogate the discourse of labelling by critically analysing its role in inclusive and special education.                                         Rationale:               Labels have a strong tradition of orchestrating educational inequity. In response, recent debates about the concept of labelling have focused on whether the use of labelling in inclusive and/or special education has an equality potential or indeed threatens the quality of education provided to students with diverse needs.                                         Findings:               The difficulty with labelling is that it is fraught with political, psychological and ideological ambiguities that permeate the well-intentioned efforts of providing education to students with disabilities. Labelling also carries considerable historical beliefs that saturates policy, professional, and institutional practices.                                         Limitations:               This article is a position piece which has put forward an argument based on available evidence. However, as with all non-empirical articles it is limited to the quality of the articles which are cited by the authors and it may not reflect the breadth of available articles on this subject area.                                         Conclusions:               Therefore, understanding how labels promote, or impede, the quality of special and inclusive education within international contexts is essential for developing realistic innovations in policy and practice to enhance educational outcomes for all.},

Society focuses on the individual as the cause of his or her own state of homelessness, blaming the victim rather than focusing on the larger antecedent social and economic forces, such as unemployment, limited affordable housing, and breakdowns in kinship networks. Social stigma occurs in situations where there is unequal social, economic, and political power and there is an opportunity to label, stereotype, separate (us versus them), lose status, and discriminate. Stigmatization is due, in part, when people feel threatened by another group. Society categorizes people who are homeless as no longer ``useful'' and/or ``functional'' members of capitalism, since they do not actively work and support the system. The paper ends on a discussion of the limits of social change in a capitalist society.},

  abstract = {Introduction{\enspace} Given the increasing rates of homelessness in recent years, there is an urgent need to address the ongoing discrimination and societal disinterest in preventing, reducing and ending homelessness. There is no systematic review of experiences of stigma and discrimination among persons experiencing homelessness or interventions to combat this discrimination. The objective for the proposed study is to identify ways in which persons experiencing homelessness have been stigmatised and discriminated against, the results of these experiences, and interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination towards persons experiencing homelessness. Methods and analysis{\enspace} We are conducting a scoping review with guidance from the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis and Arksey and O'Malley's framework. From 15 to 19 July 2022, we searched the following databases from our institutional licensed years of coverage: Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Ultimate, APA PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts \& Humanities Citation Index, Emerging Sources Citation Index, Left, PAIS International, PILOTS, Psychology \& Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertations and Theses Global. Two independent reviewers are screening study titles/abstracts and will independently screen the full texts. Study inclusion criteria include any study type reporting primary findings of English-\-language research on non-r\-efugee persons experiencing homelessness in any type of setting or service worldwide. Three reviewers will then chart data of our included studies. Data will be extracted and organised into categories and subthemes in tabular form. To understand the validity of the scoping review findings in the local context and to gather additional perspectives on the topic, we will conduct an `expert consultation' workshop. Ethics and dissemination{\enspace} This study has ethics approval from the University of Utah Institutional Review Board. Review findings will be disseminated through a peer-r\-eviewed journal and at conferences. We plan to preregister this protocol with Open Science Framework.},

Earlier research by Weiner and colleagues (1988) examined stigmatizing attitudes associated with general health disabilities in terms of attributions about the controllability and stability of these disabilities. The relevance of this model for describing attributions about four psychiatric disorders is examined in this study. One hundred and fifty two adults rated four psychiatric groups (cocaine addiction, depression, psychosis, and mental retardation) and two physical health groups (cancer and AIDS) on six items corresponding with controllability and stability attributions. Findings from a factor analysis supported the distinction between controllability and stability factors. Results also suggested that mental health disabilities were rated more negatively on these factors than physical disabilities. Participants clearly discriminated among mental health disabilities, with cocaine addiction rated most negative in terms of controllability and mental retardation rated most negative in terms of stability. Attribution analyses provide useful information for changing the community's reactions to persons with mental illness. {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Using survey data containing responses to hypothetical vignettes, we examine these relationships in a sample of 518 community college students. Consistent with attribution theory, causal attributions affect beliefs about persons' responsibility for causing their condition, beliefs which in turn lead to affective reactions, resulting in rejecting responses such as avoidance, coercion, segregation, and withholding help. However, consistent with a danger appraisal hypothesis, the effects of perceptions of dangerousness on helping and rejecting responses are unmediated by responsibility beliefs. Much of the dangerousness effects operate by increasing fear, a particularly strong predictor of support for coercive treatment. The results from this study also suggest that familiarity with mental illness reduces discriminatory responses.},

Combinations of warmth and competence generate distinct emotions of admiration, contempt, envy, and pity. From these intergroup emotions and stereotypes, the behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes (BIAS) map predicts distinct behaviors: active and passive, facilitative and harmful. After defining warmth/communion and competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or warm but not competent. Finally, the chapter addresses unresolved issues and future research directions.},

We discuss the utility of this concept in progressing two major research agendas across the social and behavioural sciences: the impact of motivation on cognition and normative behaviour, and the influence of norms on the policy process. Key contributions from considering norms from this evolutionary perspective include: (1) an improved model of the motivations that lead individuals to follow norms, (2) clarification of how and when incentives successfully generate motivations favouring sustainability and (3) new ideas for leveraging the influence of norms in public policy beyond financial incentives and education campaigns.},

(3) Increased political diversity would improve social psychological science by reducing the impact of bias mechanisms such as confirmation bias, and by empowering dissenting minorities to improve the quality of the majority's thinking.

In the present studies, we examined whether subtly different linguistic descriptions of accidents influence how much people blame and punish those involved. In three studies, participants judged how much people involved in particular accidents should be blamed and how much they should have to pay for the resulting damage. The language used to describe the accidents differed subtly across conditions: Either agentive (transitive) or nonagentive (intransitive) verb forms were used. Agentive descriptions led participants to attribute more blame and request higher financial penalties than did nonagentive descriptions. Further, linguistic framing influenced judgments, even when participants reasoned about a well-known event, such as the ``wardrobe malfunction'' of Super Bowl 2004. Importantly, this effect of language held, even when people were able to see a video of the event. These results demonstrate that even when people have rich established knowledge and visual information about events, linguistic framing can shape event construal, with important real-world consequences. Subtle differences in linguistic descriptions can change how people construe what happened, attribute blame, and dole out punishment.

In the fourth paragraph of the Status Predicts Competence, and Competition Predicts Warmth section, the results are worded in a confusing way, and some values are wrong. In the fourth paragraph's first sentence, all correlation coefficients mistakenly omitted the negative sign implied in the text ('negatively correlated') and shown in the correct values reported in Table 6. The text should appear instead as follows: Perceived competition negatively correlated with perceived warmth for the student sample, group-level r(21) .68, p {$<$} .001; individual-level r(71) .22, p {$<$} .1, and the nonstudent sample, group-level r(21) .53, p {$<$} .001; individual-level r(36) .11, ns.] Stereotype research emphasizes systematic processes over seemingly arbitrary contents, but content also may prove systematic. On the basis of stereotypes' intergroup functions, the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (1) 2 primary dimensions are competence and warmth, (2) frequent mixed clusters combine high warmth with low competence (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth (envious), and (3) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, contempt) differentiate the 4 competence-warmth combinations. Stereotypically, (4) status predicts high competence, and competition predicts low warmth. Nine varied samples rated gender, ethnicity, race, class, age, and disability out-groups. Contrary to antipathy models, 2 dimensions mattered, and many stereotypes were mixed, either pitying (low competence, high warmth subordinates) or envying (high competence, low warmth competitors).

Moreover, when the labels were removed and no longer present, the effect of the labels, although diminished, persisted. It did not make any difference whether the labels were simply abandoned or, in addition, had their validity challenged. The results are important for our understanding of categorization and labeling processes. The potential theoretical and practical implications of these results for social processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Rising homelessness in the United States has been a considerable source of concern, with policymakers and community members calling for ``solutions.'' Stigma, as a societal barrier to addressing inequity, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for people experiencing homelessness (PEH) and presents a barrier to the proposed solutions. Given that using surveys to study stigma against PEH carries potential social desirability bias, our research team used Twitter, a microblogging platform comprised of 140character messages (aka, tweets), to get a snapshot of how American Twitter users stigmatize PEH. We conducted a content analysis of 6,400 tweets regarding homelessness collected over 3 months. Our analysis was informed by Erving Goffman's theoretical framework regarding stigma. Consistent with Goffman's work, we illustrate the ways that Twitter users rationalized the situation of PEH by creating a ``stigma theory,'' in which they attribute undesirable characteristics to PEH, highlight the multiple ways in which they ``deserve'' to be homeless because of their character flaws, and emphasize their devalued ``bottom of the heap'' status. We describe the ways that this stigma theory of homelessness is expressed in tweets regarding interactions between PEH and housed individuals. Complementing Goffman's work as applied to PEH, we also describe the ways in which Twitter users impute additional stigmatized identities onto PEH and the role that disgust plays in stigma against PEH. Our findings suggest the need for a multi-level response to stigma, including addressing stigma at the individual and structural levels and providing housing to PEH across communities.},

  abstract = {Background:Individuals with mental and neurological illnesses face stigma and discrimination every day. There are only a few studies regarding the degree of discrimination in the comparison between the illnesses, and no recent research has been found in Argentina about this topic.Aims:The aim of this research is to study and compare stigma and discrimination toward people with mental illnesses (schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and bipolar disorder) and with neurological disorders (epilepsy) in Argentina, while analyzing the social distance toward them. The level of responsibility attributed to individuals with these disorders were also assessed and compared.Method:Individuals from Buenos Aires, Argentina, were surveyed in order to measure the social distance given to people with mental illnesses and a neurological disease. For that purpose a modified version of the Bogardus scale was used, with a sample of 500 individuals contacted online in January 2021.Results:Social distance toward people with mental illnesses was higher than those with a neurological disorder (epilepsy). A significant difference was found in the level of responsibility attributed to people with substance use disorder in comparison to the other illnesses. On the contrary, there were no significant differences of discrimination according to age or sex. Finally, the research outcomes showed that people with substance use disorder are the most discriminated against and stigmatized.Conclusion:A significant level of discrimination was found against individuals with mental disorders and, specially, toward people with substance use disorder. Moreover, they are perceived as responsible for their disorder. For this reason, anti-stigma campaigns should be directed to end the misconceptions toward the most discriminated groups. More support is needed to counteract the stigmatization and exclusion of individuals with mental and neurological disorders in our society.},

According to theory about stigma and about inequality-legitimating ideologies, homeless people should be stigmatized even more severely than the "generic poor". Recent research suggests that the opposite may be true, but the data used in comparing attitudes toward homeless and other poor people have not been strictly comparable. Thus the conclusions that can be drawn are limited. Using a vignette experiment designed to directly compare attitudes toward a homeless and a domiciled poor man and to compare the effects of being labeled homeless with those of being labeled mentally ill, we find that (1) the homeless man is blamed no less than the domiciled man and generally is stigmatized more severely; (2) the strength of the stigma attached to the "homelessness" label equals that for mental hospitalization; and (3) the stigmas of homelessness and mental hospitalization are independent of one another. Thus, in addition to the hardships of the homeless condition itself, homeless people suffer stigmatization by their fellow citizens. The results also suggest that the robust tendency to blame the disadvantaged for their predicament holds true for modern homelessness as well.},

First, I define descriptive-to-prescriptive reasoning and review previous research on how it maintains the status quo. Second, I review a recent pro\- gramme of research on the early development of descriptive-to-prescriptive reasoning. Third, I provide suggestions for future research, particularly in the domain of redirecting descriptive-to-prescriptive reasoning for good.

  abstract = {When a person's language appears to be political---such as being politically correct or incorrect---it can influence fundamental impressions of him or her. Political correctness is ``using language or behavior to seem sensitive to others' feelings, especially those others who seem socially disadvantaged.'' One pilot study, 6 experiments, and 3 Supplemental Experiments (N = 4,922) demonstrate that being politically incorrect makes communicators appear more authentic---specifically, less susceptible to external influence---albeit also less warm. These effects, however, are moderated by perceivers' political ideology and how sympathetic perceivers feel toward the target group being labeled politically correctly. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3 using politically incorrect language (e.g., calling undocumented immigrants illegals) made a communicator appear particularly authentic among conservative perceivers but particularly cold among liberal perceivers. However, in Experiment 4 these effects reversed when conservatives felt sympathetic toward the group that was being labeled politically correctly or incorrectly (e.g., calling poor Whites white trash). Experiment 5 tests why political incorrectness can boost authenticity, demonstrating that it makes communicators seem less strategic. Finally, Experiment 6 examines the use of political language in a meaningful field context: perceived persuasion in real political debates. Debaters instructed to be politically correct (vs. politically incorrect) were judged by their uninstructed conversation partners to be easier to persuade during the conversation, although they actually reported being similarly persuaded. Together, these findings demonstrate when and how using politically incorrect language can enhance a person's authenticity.},

CPC assesses individual differences in concern for politically correct speech. Exploratory and confirmatory structural equation modeling showed consistent factor structure of the two subscales; an emotion subscale measuring negative emotional response to hearing politically incorrect language, and an activism subscale measuring a willingness to correct others who use politically incorrect language. Correlational analyses suggested that concern for political correctness is associated with more liberal beliefs and ideologies and less right-wing authoritarianism. The emotion subscale was also found to be associated with lower emotional well-being and the activism subscale with more frequent arguments. Laboratory-based criterion validation studies indicated that the two subscales predicted negative reactions to politically incorrect humor.},

  abstract = {Three experiments examined the effects of essentialist linguistic labels on perceptions of preferences of others and of the self. In Experiment 1, participants evaluated the preferences of others described with noun labels (e.g., ``Susan is a chocolate-eater'') as stronger, more stable, and more resilient than those described with descriptive action verbs (``Susan eats chocolate a lot''). Experiments 2 and 3 revealed the analogous effect for self-perception: participants evaluated their own preferences that they had described with nouns (rather than verbs) as stronger, more stable, and more resilient. These results indicate that the very manner in which attitudes are expressed can affect their status and evaluation. Linguistic forms that imply essentialist properties (e.g., nouns) can engender the inference that such attitudes are dispositional and therefore strong and stable. More generally, these results show that attitudes are plastic constructions shaped by subtle but pervasive cognitive and social input from the environment.},

  abstract = {An attributional analysis of reactions to poverty is presented. The article begins by discussing the perceived causes of poverty and their taxonomic properties (locus, stability, and controllability). One antecedent of causal beliefs, political ideology, is then examined in detail, followed by a review of the effects of causal beliefs on emotions and behavior. It is contended that helping the poor is a moral issue, but the moral evaluation concerns the targeted recipient of aid rather than the potential help giver. Persons perceived as responsible for their plight, a dominant construal for conservatives, elicit anger and neglect. In contrast, those seen as not responsible for their financial hardship, an outlook predominantly endorsed by liberals, arouse sympathy and help giving. Sympathy is the most important proximal determinant of aid. This analysis is extended to reactions to achievement failure, abortion, and rape. Policy implications are also examined.},

I don't mean any ill will when using outdated terms. It is what I grew up with so it is almost like muscle memory. I think what I am saying is give some grace to people who may not always be politically correct. They are probably empathetic and want to help, but chastising their vocabulary is not a good method to bring about change."

Reality is, most individuals who are experiencing this are doing so because of an underlying issue (such as alcohol or drub addiction)It is tragic, but we have to figure that portion of the issue out first to help with the actual homlessness"
